qed: QED (Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness) is a measure that quantifieshow
  'drug-like' a molecule is based on properties such as molecular weight,solubility,
  and the number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.Adding functional groups that
  improve drug-like properties (e.g., small molecular size,balanced hydrophilicity)
  can increase QED, while introducing large, complex, or highly polar groups can decrease
  it.
logp: LogP is the logarithm of the partition coefficient, measuring the lipophilicityor
  hydrophobicity of a molecule, indicating its solubility in fats versus water.Adding
  hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains or aromatic rings) increases LogP,while adding
  polar or hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl or carboxyl groups) decreases it.
donor: Donor Number refers to the number of hydrogen bond donors (atoms like NH or
  OH) in a molecule,influencing its interaction with biological targets.Introducing
  additional hydrogen bond donors (e.g., hydroxyl or amine groups) increasesthe Donor
  Number, while removing or modifying these groups decreases it.
similarity: Similarity in this context is calculated using Morgan fingerprints, which
  represent molecularstructures, and Tanimoto similarity measures how structurally
  similar two molecules are based on their fingerprints.Modifying the core structure
  of a molecule significantly (e.g., ring opening or closing) decreases similarity,while
  smaller changes like side-chain substitutions tend to have a lesser impact on similarity.
logs: Log S indicates the solubility of a molecule in water, with higher values showing
  better solubility. Adding polar functional groups (like -OH or -COOH) can increase
  Log S, while adding hydrophobic groups (like long alkyl chains) can decrease it.
reduction_potential: Reduction potential quantifies a molecule's tendency to gain
  electrons and undergo reduction. Introducing electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2)
  can increase reduction potential, while adding electron-donating groups (like -OH
  or -CH3) can decrease it.
sa: SA measures how easily a molecule can be synthesized based on its structural complexity.
  Simplifying a molecule by reducing complex ring systems or functional groups can
  lower SA, making synthesis easier, while adding complex structures can increase
  SA, making synthesis harder.
drd2: Dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) is a receptor involved in the modulation of neurotransmission
  and is a target for various psychiatric and neurological disorders. Adding functional
  groups like hydroxyl or halogen atoms to aromatic rings can enhance binding affinity
  to DRD2. Removing aromaticity or introducing bulky groups near the binding sites
  often decreases DRD2 activity.
gsk3b: Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, also known as GSK3β, is an enzyme that in humans is 
  encoded by the GSK3β gene. Abnormal regulation and expression of GSK3β is associated with an
   increased susceptibility towards bipolar disorder. The oracle is a random forest classifer using ECFP6 fingerprints
jnk3: c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) is a kinase involved in stress signaling and
  is targeted for neuroprotection in diseases like Alzheimer's.Introducing small polar
  or electronegative groups can enhance binding affinity to JNK3.Removing polar functional
  groups or adding large, bulky substituents can reduce activity by obstructing the
  active site.
bbbp: The BBBP (Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability) is a measure of how well a molecule
  can cross the blood-brain barrierIncreasing the hydrophobicity, optimizing molecular
  size, and modifying functional groups to enhance lipophilicity can increase BBBP.Introducing
  polar or charged groups, increasing molecular size, and adding hydrogen-bond donors
  can decrease BBBP.

celecoxib_rediscovery: celecoxib_rediscovery evaluates whether the model can generate
  Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, indicating the capacity to rediscover a known, structurally
  complex drug. Adding sulfonamide or diaryl heterocycle structures can increase similarity.

  Thiothixene, an antipsychotic, which challenges models to recover less common or
  complex molecules. Preserving the tricyclic core and adding a piperazine ring increases
  similarity. Breaking the tricyclic core or replacing the piperazine diminishes similarity.
albuterol_similarity: albuterol_similarity encourages generation of molecules structurally
  and chemically similar to Albuterol, a β2-agonist used in asthma, measuring chemical
  similarity. Adding a hydroxyphenethylamine backbone and β-hydroxy groups increases
  similarity. Replacing the phenyl ring or removing hydroxyl groups decreases similarity.
mestranol_similarity: mestranol_similarity targets molecules similar to Mestranol,
  a synthetic estrogen, highlighting the model's capacity to capture nuanced structural
  features. Preserving the steroid nucleus and ether at C3 increases similarity. Opening
  the steroid ring system or removing the C3 ether reduces similarity.
