# Write a description for your problem
description: This task is to propose better solution for circle_packing problem where 32 circles in a unit square.

# This part is important, you should set your output format here, and probably give an simple example. The <candidate></candidate> is fixed.
example_output: 'Each output new candidate must start with <candidate> and end with
  </candidate> in SMILES format. Example one output: <candidate>centers = np.array([
    [0.50, 0.50], [0.30, 0.50], ...
  ])
  radii = np.array([
    0.12, 0.10, ...
  ])</candidate>'

# Optional mutation and crossover instrution, helpful for better operation, you should start with:"Example operations include: "
mutation_instruction: 'Example operations include:
  change the values of circle coordinates or radii
  '
crossover_instruction: 'Example operations include:
  switch the values between parents for better candidate'

# Optional, some extra requirements you would like to achieve
other_requirements: ' The only requirements is just keep the centers inside the unit square. 
  Largely change these values (coordinate, orders, and raddi) with your knowledge, significant deviations from the original values are encouraged.
  and do not need to worry about validity becuase I will fix the overlap and out of boundary.'

# The following part are the description of the objectives involved. It is simply consisted of a sentence describe the objective and [optional] normally 
# what operation could cause a rise or drop. 
radii: this objective is the sum of radii of circles.
